CS341
=====

Code dump of things wrote for CS341. Code includes implementations of various ensemble methods. Please read my term paper, bit.ly/17eYqQz , for an understanding of the project and the methods employed.

Lots of inspiration for the RBM was gained from this repo of an RBM used for the Netflix competition: https://code.google.com/p/nprizeadditions/source/browse/trunk/rbm.c
